#Plum

A magazine by Lulu & Friends.

Hello and welcome to a magical world where you can open this app and see and collect weird stuff created by Lulu (that's me!) and my friends.

###Please note that this is a work in progress and definitely, definitely, definitely should not be used yet.

##WHAT?

A magazine in the form of an iOS app focused on content creation and aimed towards creative people.

Each day the app presents a set of X number of “cards” to you. Each card contains a piece of content. You can collect cards from the ones the app presents to you each day and keep a collection of them including all cards you had collected in the past. However, if you don’t collect card X from that day, it will probably be a while until it comes back - if it ever does. Sort of like favoriting a post on Tumblr. 

You can then later make copies of your cards and give them to other people. Like trading the card, but you get to keep a copy, too.

##MAYBE THIS, TOO

###Content-curation
Possibly allow users to submit their own content under different categories (listed below). All content will still be moderated and hand-picked by me/creators, but facilitates even more content creation. Perhaps users can only submit things in the “Cool” categories, not the “Creation” categories. Possibly have a day per week of only user-submitted content.

###iBeacon
Allow users to trade cards through Bluetooth and iBeacon when they’re close to each other.

###Geo-tagging
Certain cards only come up if you’re near a location.
